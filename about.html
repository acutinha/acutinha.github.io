      <h3 class="my-5 mb-3">Why I chose Computer Science</h3>
      <p> As a proud engineering Aggie, I started my journey at Galveston. During my first semester I got an opportunity to serve the University by joining the HR department as a student assistant. I happily grabbed the opportunity and entered the field. As I advanced at my work, I realized that the department had an excellent team that came up with brilliant ideas related to HR. However, they were unsuccessful in accurately representing them on their webpage. The website that they had was not very fluid and dynamic. As months passed by my supervisor noticed my interest in computer science and asked me if I would help her redesign the website. As a computer enthusiast I seized the opportunity to be a web developer. I learnt variations of my skills needed to redesign the webpage and jumped into the code. In this moment, I realized the importance of my major in my society. </p>
      <p> Computers today provide technology and data and help humans perform difficult tasks. They have undoubtedly become an integral part of our lives. An average human’s life today is built around computers. These multi-capable machines touch almost every aspect of our lives. In the 90s, computer science classes were considered a luxury. They were fun and informative but not necessary. That is no longer true. Computer Science has become an integral part of almost every field. The things we use daily were developed by or with the help of computer science. Computer Science still mainly remains as a supportive field. Its main power is improving and accelerating other fields. </p>
      <p> Computer Science directly meets the needs of the society. Over time, multiple computer applications have sufficed the society’s needs. From banking to driving, it has covered everything. Computer scientists build applications that directly address societal issues like economic crisis, unemployment, and others. For example, climate change is a major issue humanity faces today. Computer scientists in Europe have come up with a proposal to build a European Supercomputer Infrastructure (“CERN of climate”). This machine would use newly developed machine learning algorithms instead of the presently used traditional algorithms to map accurate real-time scenarios of various parts of the world (eurekalert.org). The current methods require long computation time to produce predictions and moreover, these predictions are average forecasts for a large region. The supercomputer would be able to produce real time scenarios for specific locations. This just shows how computer science remains a versatile field that provides efficient and easy solutions that can be easily implemented.</p>
      <p> Computer Science acts as a tool in paving the way to an equal world. Computer Scientists can provide inexpensive solutions and it does not matter who made the code. This fact empowers people who are often overlooked in other fields and provides them an opportunity to showcase their talents to the world and bring about change. This brings about a domino effect that improves every aspect of the society. For example, people who do not own a car can easily find a ride; people new to town or people who just do not remember routes can reach their destination without getting lost easily with just a push of a button. </p>
      <p> These are just some of the impacts Computer Science has made on our society let apart the education and medical system. I was fascinated by computer science from an early age. With the development of e-commerce through my childhood, I saw the benefits and positive impacts computer science had on society. The internet really brought the world closer. I could not be here today as an international student without computer science. Through my personal experiences growing up, travelling, and working, I have realized that computer science has become the universal language of the modern world. Therefore, computer scientists strive to open new potentials in making this world a better place and I believe by making my passion my purpose I will join them soon.</p>
